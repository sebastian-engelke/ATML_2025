    "When you write \"universal\" python code like functions and class definitions, you might want to reuse the same bit of code in a different file, notebook, or project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing reusable code is a very useful habit (at least in the long run) and highly recommended!\n",

    "Below are a few different methods how you can easily reuse the same piece of code in different locations.\n",
